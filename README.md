# python_myfirst_code
This is my first codes and note for myself when i started *programming*.
I know these notes are *terrible*, but I was new to programming and **had no prior knowledge of programming**. 
On the other hand, I typed these codes on a very old PC that bothered me, and in the year before the exam, which is really respectable for me.

Anyway, I will save these codes here as a souvenir, even though I have them on my device.
